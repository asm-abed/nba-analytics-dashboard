# NBA PLAYER ANALYTICS DASHBOARD
# Overview

This repo is developed as a capstone project for DataTalks Club's Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024. The purpose of this project is to apply all the concepts and tools that we have learned and create an end-to-end data pipeline. 
<br>
<br>
The objectives of this specific project are: 
<br>
	- to create end-to-end pipelines to store NBA player statistics data from 1997-present<br>
 	- perform different transformations from this data and show it to a dashboard<br>
