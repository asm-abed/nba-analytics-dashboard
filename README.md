# NBA PLAYER ANALYTICS DASHBOARD

Hi! This is my repo is intended as my capstone project for DataTalks Club's Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2024! 

# Project Objectives

The objective of this project is to create end-to-end pipelines to store NBA player statistics data from 1997-present. From this data, I created transformations to show the summary of statistics per player per season and using a prediction model deviced by a sports analytics study, I also made some transformations that would put that model to test.
